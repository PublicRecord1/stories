        We would like you to close your eyes and think about the ways that climate change manifests in your life. 
        Put yourself back into that specific moment in time when you had a realization about the climate crisis and how it impacted you. 
        Describe what you see in detail. 
        <br><br>
        Where were you? <br>
        What was happening? <br><br>
        Think about your own personal responses to climate change. 
        Can you give an example of how you have failed to respond to the climate crisis? 
        Conversely, can you describe how you have effectively responded to climate change? 
        <br><br>
        Imagine that you are a historian from the future looking back to this moment of time, trying to understand the socio-environmental trauma of the era. 
        <br>
        What is important to remember from this moment
